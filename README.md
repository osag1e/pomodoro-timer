# pomodoro-timer
CLI Pomodoro timer with work and break duration alerts. 
Note: The sound alerts currently only work for macOS.

This pomodoro-timer is designed to work exclusively for Mac and Linux users.

Since I no longer use a Mac, I have commented out the call_alert function. 
If you are using a Mac, you can locate the pomodoro.mojo file and
uncomment the call_alert function within the display_message function scope.
Additionally, you'll need to modify the file path in the setup_python_path function
to enable the sound alert feature.
